        <p>With the country’s population increasing and the loss of thousands of homes to natural disasters, there currently exists a massive housing deficit. According to the Subdivision and Housing Developers Association, Inc. (SHDA), the backlog currently stands at 3.9 million units and could rise to 6.5 million in 2030 if the issue is not addressed.


            In response to the SHDA’s continuously urging the government to step up their efforts to address this problem, Batasang Pambansa 220 (BP220) was created. This government act encourages the private sector to engage in the development of economic and socialized housing in both urban and rural areas across the country.
